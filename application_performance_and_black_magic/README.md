# Application Performance & Black Magic

Why are applications slow? Well probably because you don’t have the visibility to tell you that it’s slow. Then when you find out that it is slow, how do you fix it? These are important questions. Unfortunately the answer usually seems like black magic. The first half the talk is about visibility. It highlights tools such as statsd, ruby-prof, benchmark, and rack-mini-prof to bring visibility into all parts of the stack. The second part is how out act on metrics and improve the performance of ruby code as well as external services (such as HTTP and databases). The audience should have all they need at the end of the talk to use the scientific method to improve their applications performance.

Tools mentioned:


   * ruby-prof
   * harness
   * statsd
   * graphite
   * librato
   * rack-mini-prof
   * rails performance tests
   * httperf
   * ab
   * httping
   * siege
   * varnish
